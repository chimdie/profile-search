# GITHUB Profile Search

Created this for entry at [Buycoins](https://notion.so/) as a Frontend Developer role - to use [GihubGraphql](https://api.github.com/graphql) and generate user profiles and their repositories. 

## Takeaways
1. This is my first go at graghql and I must say it was a nice ride.
2. Had a nice time learning and sharing info with [Sam](https://github.com/sammy-code98)
3. I couldn't meet up with the deadline for submissionðŸ˜• but yeah am happy I did perform the task and learnt doing it.
