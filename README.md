# GITHUB Profile Search

Created this for entry at [Buycoins](https://notion.so/) as a Frontend Developer role - to use [GihubGraphql](https://api.github.com/graphql) and generate user profiles and their repositories and here's is a live [Demo](https://github-abc.netlify.app/).<br /> 
PS: It's only for mobile😐

## Takeaways
1. This is my first go at graghql and I must say it was a nice ride.
2. I couldn't meet up with the deadline for submission😕 but yeah am happy I did perform the task and learnt doing it.
